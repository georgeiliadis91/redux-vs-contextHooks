A simple create-react-app project.

## This is a repo that is comparing the implementation of Redux vs useContext/useReducer for global state management.

The project is a very simple Cart where you add products to your cart on the Home page. And remove them to your Cart page.

The master branch is good old fashioned state that is passed from parent to child.

The redux-version branch, is an implementation of the cart with a redux global state and global reducer.

And the hooks version branch is an implementation of a global state with useContext and useReducer.
